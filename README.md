The Simon Game

The Simon Game is designed to test your memory. The Simon Game has four colored buttons/tiles. The colors are Red, Blue,
Yellow and Green, which is also asigned a sound. The Game has also two game modes, a Normal game mode and a Strict
game mode. In the Normal the game is started by pushing the Start button and The Simon Game will start a sequence, 
where one of the colored buttons/tiles will light up and play a sound, then the player has the chance to follow the sequence,
by pushing the colored button/tile that lit up. Once the player has pushed that color button/tile, the simon game will check
if the correct button/tile was pushed, then the Simon Game will play add another color button/tile to the sequence. 
The color sequence will play until the player reaches the end of the game that is a sequence of 20 buttons/tiles. 
If the player pushes the wrong button/tile, the Simon Game will play the sequence over so the player can see which
button/tile was added to the sequence.

The Strict mode is switched on by pressing the Strict mode button. In the Strict the plays as in the Normal game, where the 
game will start a sequence for the player to follow, but when the player pushes the wrong button/tile in the sequence the 
game will end and it is Game Over. 

The differnce between the Normal game and Strict game is when playing the Normal game you get a chance to get the sequence correct,
but in the Strict game there is NO time for errors.

The game can be reset to start a New Game by pushing the start button at the bottom of the screen. Once you have pushed the start button during
a game, the game will start over with a new sequence of colored buttons/tiles. Once you had enough enjoyment for one day you can push the Power 
button and the game will switch off and no buttons/tiles are able to be pushed to light up and play their sound.

User Excperience

User Story: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

User Story: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an
additional step.

User Story: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I 
personally press a button.

User Story: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again
to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

User Story: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

User Story: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

User Story: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game
restarts at a new random series of button presses.

User Story: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts
over.

Features

In this project the buttons flash and the user is to copy the sequence and click the correct button.

You can change the mode from 'medium' to 'hard'.

You can reset the game throughout the game.

I have a counter so the user knows what level they are on throughout the game.

The coloured buttons change positions when you move on the next level in hard mode.

I have used a random function which will allow the game to use a unique sequence each time.

I have used 'start' and 'reset' buttons to let the user have control of the game.

Credits

I have used the website 'https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/162096/simon-game-in-javascript' for research in
creating the game. I needed an understanding of what to expect my game too look like and how it would work. After looking
at this persons game, i decided that mine was going to be similar but with different functions and a complete new design.
